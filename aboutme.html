                Castle High School and will be taking part in a third-year 
                Capstone course where I’ll get to design and develop independent
                projects. I also work as a front-end development intern with
                Nextech Catapult, where I’m gaining hands-on experience coding 
                websites and building interactive projects.

                I’m especially interested in Rose-Hulman or the University of
                Chicago, and my goal is to work as a front-end software developer
                creating innovative and user-friendly digital experiences.
