            <p class="myexperiencetext">Creating this portfolio was a rewarding
                experience that helped me grow in several ways.
                I deepened my understanding of web development by learning how to
                style pages with CSS and add interactivity using JavaScript. With 
                each challenge, my confidence as a coder grew. I learned to
                think more creatively, troubleshoot independently, and developed a
                problem-solving mindset. Along the way, I connected with others, 
                and sharing feedback and ideas made the process even
                more meaningful. In the end, this portfolio became more than just a 
                collection of work — it’s a reflection of how much I’ve learned and
                 how much I enjoy building and learning with others.
